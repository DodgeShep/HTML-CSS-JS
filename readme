## 1. Project Description
This project is a RSVP 3 page website for my daughters 4th birthday. In total it contains a RSVP form, party details and links to her Amazon list plus some other gift ideas. The style is taken from her actual invitations this year I will drop in the images folder if you are curious to see twhat they look like.

- Images/ (folder containing all the images and the actual invitations)

### 6. Challenges Faced
 - The biggest challenges I faced were the animations and making everything look good on different device sizes. The sparkle rain took me like 5 hours because I am bad at coding but I did get it down eventually. 

### 7. AI Usage
- I used Chat GPT with pulling the colors from the original invitation, helping debug in general but mostly the dancing/rockingg animation and the sparkle rain(straight up stolen from your fall leaves lecture because it was so cute). 

### 8. Future Improvements
-I think in the future I can add a guestlist and gifts bought section to prevent double gifting. Also so other guests can see who else is going. My plan is to actually impliment this next year on her invitations. 

### 9. Credits
- chatgpt
- Canva.com ( her original invites)
- Good old fashion google image search 
- [background remover for pngs](https://www.remove.bg/)
- Bootstrap for containers.
