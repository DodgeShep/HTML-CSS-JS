         <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello! My name is Dodge Shepard.<br> </br>
            I am a pregnant, special needs mother who also happens to be a full time student. Although I was born in NV I did the majority of my growing in WA.
            When asked where I am from I usually say WA. I have two handsome pets, both a cat and a dog. I am currently working on my associates in computer science
             and plan to transfer to University of Washington to finish my bachelors. Once finished with my bachelors I plan to work as a Software Engineer. 
         </p>
