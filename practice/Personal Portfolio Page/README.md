I kept the base of last weeks assignment and added on to it. It has a nav bar, images, submission form connected to my email, and both flexbox and grid usage. 
I wasn't really sure what to put in the project cards so I put in some school projects I've done in the last few months. 
Flexbox was implimented in the pics and captions, projects, and nav bar. I felt it was a little easier to set up that way than with a grid. I used a grid for the about me section of my page to keep it simple. Although my page has other pages connected to it, I fit everything in the instructions on one page so I hope you don't dock me points for that. 
Additionally I do remember you mentioning the page should work on multiple devices, I tested both an iphone and ipad with the inspector tool and they looked fine so I didnt edit my code.
